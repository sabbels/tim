# Exercice Tim Berners-Lee
exercice tim berners-lee

This is my second try at this exercice.

The first time, I ignored the responsive part of the exercice as well as other directives.

This time, I'd like to try again and see if anything comes more naturally to me.

A few notes for myself before:
- don't forget your readme
- try to make it responsive
- try to really use flexboxes
- adjust size img in css
-
